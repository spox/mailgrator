== MailGrator ==

This is a mail migration script that I wrote awhile ago to move some mail
from mbox files created from old Eudora archives by emailchemy to an
IMAP server. It expanded a bit from that and now works to sync from mbox
files to IMAP and from IMAP to IMAP. I have found it especially useful on
boxes with low levels of memory. It is the reason for IMAP to IMAP support
as imapsync would continually error out with out of memory messages.

Currently, this isn't finished yet. I'm porting from it's old monolithic
script into an actual installable package, which should hopefully be done
soon.
